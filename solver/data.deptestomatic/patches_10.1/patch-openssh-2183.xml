	<summary>openssh: Security update for security problems solved in OpenSSH 4.4</summary>
	<description>Several security problems were fixed in OpenSSH:

- CVE-2006-4924: A denial of service problem has been fixed
  in OpenSSH which could be used to cause lots of CPU
  consumption on a remote openssh server.
- CVE-2006-4925: If a remote attacker is able to inject
  network traffic this could be used to cause a client
  connection to close.
- CVE-2006-5051: Fixed an unsafe signal hander reported by
  Mark Dowd. The signal handler was vulnerable to a race
  condition that could be exploited to perform a
  pre-authentication denial of service. This vulnerability
  could theoretically lead to pre-authentication remote
  code execution if GSSAPI authentication is enabled, but
  the likelihood of successful exploitation appears remote.
- CVE-2006-5052: Fixed a GSSAPI authentication abort that
  could be used to determine the validity of usernames on
  some platforms.
