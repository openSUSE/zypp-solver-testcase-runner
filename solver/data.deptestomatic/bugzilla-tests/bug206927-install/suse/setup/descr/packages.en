<!-- DT:Rich -->
bc is an interpreter that supports numbers of arbitrary precision and
the interactive execution of statements. The syntax has some
similarities to the C programming language. A standard
math library is available through command line options. When used, the
math library is read in before any other input files. bc then reads
in all other files from the command line, evaluating their contents.
Then bc reads from standard input (usually the keyboard).
<p>
The dc program is also included. dc is a calculator that supports
reverse-polish notation and allows unlimited precision arithmetic.
Macros can also be defined. Normally, dc reads from standard input but
can also read in files specified on the command line. A calculator with
reverse-polish notation saves numbers to a stack. Arguments to
mathematical operations (operands) are "pushed" onto the stack until the
next operator is read in, which "pops" its arguments off the stack and
"pushes" its results back onto the stack.

D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. D-Bus supplies both a system daemon and a per-user-login-session daemon. Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon).

check for well-formedness. An option -d dir can be
specified. For each well-formed input file, the corresponding canonical
XML is written to dir/f, where f is the filename (without any path)
of the input file. A -x option causes references to external general
entities to be processed. A -s option makes documents that are not
stand-alone cause an error (a document is considered stand-alone if
it is intrinsically stand-alone because it has no external subset and no
references to parameter entities in the internal subset or it is
declared as stand-alone in the XML declaration).

FTGL uses the Freetype (www.freetype.org) font library to open and 'decode'
the fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a format that is most efficient
for OpenGL rendering.

Rendering modes supported are:<ul>
<li>Bit maps
<li>Antialiased Pix maps
<li>Texture maps
<li>Outlines
<li>Polygon meshes
<li>Extruded polygon meshes

/dev/irlpt0. If you like to talk to other computers with infrared interface
or to a mobile phone, you can use the serial emulation provided by the device
file /dev/ircomm0.
<p>
Take a look at the README file located in
/usr/share/doc/packages/irda/README and the IRDA HOWTO in
/usr/share/doc/howto/en/IR-HOWTO.gz. If the infrared port on your laptop is
located on an IO or IRQ address other than IO address 0x2f8 (/dev/ttyS1)

=Pkg: jpeg 6b 755 i586
=Sum: Independent JPEG Group's JPEG Software
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG
(pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for
full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
"real-world" scenes (most of the time these are pictures that have
been scanned-in with a scanner or taken with a digital camera).
Cartoons and other nonrealistic images
are not its strong suit. It should be noted that JPEG output is not
necessarily the same as its input. If this is a factor for you,
do not use it. With typical real-world scenes, JPEG can achieve
high compression rates without noticeable differences. If
you can accept pictures of lower quality, JPEG can achieve amazingly
high compression rates.
<p>
There are some library functions available for reading and writing
JPEG files. The 'cjpeg' and 'djpeg' applications use the library to
make conversions between JPEG and other popular graphic file formats
possible. The JPEG library is meant to be used within other applications.
<p>
Cjpeg compresses the input file, or standard input if no filename
is given, and produces a JPEG/JFIF file as standard output. Currently
supported input file formats include: PPM (PBMPLUS color format),
PGM (PBMPLUS Grayscale format), BMP, GIF, Targa, and RLE (Utah Raster
Toolkit Format) (RLE is only supported if the RLE library is
available). Djpeg decompresses a JPEG file into one of the above
mentioned formats.

Mkinitrd creates file system images for use as initial RAM disk (initrd)
images.  These RAM disk images are often used to preload the block
device modules (SCSI or RAID) needed to access the root file system.
<p>
In other words, generic kernels can be built without drivers for any
SCSI adapters that load the SCSI driver as a module.  Because the
kernel needs to read those modules, but in this case is not able to
address the SCSI adapter, an initial RAM disk is used.  The initial
RAM disk is loaded by the operating system loader (normally LILO) and
is available to the kernel as soon as the RAM disk is loaded.  The
RAM disk loads the proper SCSI adapter and allows the kernel to
mount the root file system.

<p>
One of the most unique facility of nkf is the guess of
the input kanji code.  It currently recognizes 7-bit JIS,
MS-kanji (shifted-JIS), and  EUC. So users do not need the
input Kanji code specification.
<p>
By  default,  X0201  kana is converted into X0208 kana. For
X0201 kana, SO/SI, SSO and ESC-(-I methods are  supported.
For automatic code detection, nkf assumes no X0201 kana in
MS-Kanji. To accept X0201 in MS-Kanji, use -X, -x, or -S.

<!-- DT:Rich -->
This module is aimed at environments with SMB (Samba or Windows NT)
or NCP (Netware or Mars-NWE) servers that Unix users wish to access
transparently. It facilitates access to private volumes of these types.
This module also supports mounting home directories using
loopback encrypted filesystems. The module was originally written for
use on the Linux operating system but has since been modified to
work on several flavors of BSD.
<p>
o Every user can access their own volumes
<p>
o The user only needs to type the password once (at login)
<p>
o The mounting process is transparent to the user
<p>
o There is no need to keep the login passwords in any additional files
<p>
o The volumes are unmounted on logout, so it saves system resources,
avoiding the need to list every possibly useful remote
volume in /etc/fstab or in an automount/supermount config file. This
is also necessary for securing encrypted filesystems.
<p>
Pam_mount "understands" SMB, NCP, and any type of filesystem that can
be mounted using the standard mount command. If someone has a
particular need for a different filesystem, feel free to ask me to
include it and send me patches.

=Sum: Xen Virtualization: Hypervisor (aka VMM aka Microkernel)
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
Xen is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation.
<p>
This package contains the Xen Hypervisor. (tm)
<p>
Modern computers are sufficiently powerful to use virtualization to present the illusion of many smaller virtual machines (VMs), each running a separate operating system instance. Successful partitioning of a machine to support the concurrent execution of multiple operating systems poses several challenges. Firstly, virtual machines must be isolated from one another: It is not acceptable for the execution of one to adversely affect the performance of another. This is particularly true when virtual machines are owned by mutually untrusting users. Secondly, it is necessary to support a variety of different operating systems to accommodate the heterogeneity of popular applications. Thirdly, the performance overhead introduced by virtualization should be small.
<p>
Xen uses a technique called paravirtualization: The guest OS is modified, mainly to enhance performance.
<p>
The Xen hypervisor (microkernel) does not provide device drivers for your hardware (except for CPU and memory). This job is left to the kernel that's running in domain 0. Thus the domain 0 kernel is privileged; it has full hardware access. It's started immediately after Xen starts up. Other domains have no access to the hardware; instead they use virtual interfaces that are provided by Xen (with the help of the domain 0 kernel).
<p>
Xen does support booting other Operating Systems; ports of NetBSD (Christian Limpach), FreeBSD (Kip Macy), and Plan 9 (Ron Minnich) exist. A port of Windows XP was developed for an earlier version of Xen, but is not available for release due to license restrictions.
<p>
In addition to this package you need to install the kernel-xen and xen-tools to use Xen. Xen 3 also supports running unmodified guests using full virtualization, if appropriate hardware is present. Install xen-tools-ioemu if you want to use this.

##----------------------------------------
=Pkg: convmv 1.10 5 noarch
=Sum: Converts File Names from One Encoding to Another
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
convmv is meant to help convert a directory tree and the contained
files or a whole file system into a different encoding. It just
converts the file names, not the content of the files. A special
feature of convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks and
converts the symlink target pointer in case the symlink target is
converted.
<p>
All this comes in very handy when converting from old
8-bit locales to UTF-8 locales. It is also possible to convert
directories to UTF-8 that are already partly UTF-8 encoded. convmv is
able to detect if certain files are UTF-8 encoded and skips them
by default. To turn this behavior off, use the --nosmart switch.
<p>
An interoperability issue that comes with UTF-8 locales is this: Linux
and (most?) other Unix-like operating systems use the
normalization form C (NFC) for UTF-8 encoding by default but do
not enforce this. Darwin, the base of Macintosh OSX, enforces
normalization form D (NFD), where a few characters are encoded in a
different way. convmv is able to convert files to NFC or NFD, which
aids in interoperability with such systems.

a different editor, if desired, but makes it difficult for a program
to make a good choice of editor to invoke if the user has not
specified a particular preference.

<!-- DT:Rich -->
ImageMagick is a robust collection of tools and libraries to read, write,
and manipulate an image in many image formats, including popular formats
like TIFF, JPEG, PNG, PDF, PhotoCD, and GIF. With ImageMagick, you can
create images dynamically, making it suitable for Web applications.
You can also resize, rotate, sharpen, color-reduce, or add special effects
to an image and save your completed work in many different image formats.
Image processing operations are available from the command line as well
as through C, C++, and PERL-based programming interfaces.

=Pkg: ImageMagick-Magick++ 6.2.8 5 i586
=Sum: C++ Interface for ImageMagick - runtime library
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
This is Magick++, the object-oriented C++ API for the ImageMagick
image-processing library.
<p>
Magick++ supports an object model inspired by PerlMagick. Magick++
should be faster than PerlMagick since it is written in a compiled
language which is not parsed at run-time. This makes it suitable for Web CGI
programs. Images support implicit reference counting so that copy
constructors and assignment incur almost no cost. The cost of actually
copying an image (if necessary) is done just before modification and this
copy is managed automatically by Magick++. De-referenced copies are
automatically deleted. The image objects support value (rather than
pointer) semantics so it is trivial to support multiple generations of an
image in memory at one time.

<!-- DT:Rich -->
Contains libraries and binaries for a GSM speech compressor.
libgsm contains a standard implementation of
the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech
transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse
excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
<p>
GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
rate, which is a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits. For compatibility
with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
recognition. Even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
<p>
The interfaces offered are a front-end modeled after compress(1) and
a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than real-time
on most SPARC stations.  The implementation has been verified against the
ETSI standard test patterns.

=Pkg: libieee1284 0.2.10 17 i586
=Sum: A Library for Interfacing IEEE 1284-Compatible Devices
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
This library is intended to be used by applications that need to
communicate with (or at least identify) devices that are attached via
a parallel port.
<p>
For Linux, there are some wrinkles in communicating with devices on
parallel ports (see /usr/share/doc/packages/libieee1284/README).
The aim of this library is to take all the worry about these
wrinkles from the application.  It figures out which method is
appropriate for the currently running kernel.  For instance, if the
application wants to know the device ID of a device on a particular
port, it asks the library for the the device ID.  The library
then figures out if it is available via /proc (in any of the possible
locations) and, if not, tries asking the device itself.  If
/dev/parport0 is not available for use, it tries ioperm; if that
fails, it tries /dev/port.  The application does not have to
care.

+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
When editing HTML it's easy to make mistakes. Wouldn't it be nice if
there was a simple way to fix these mistakes automatically and tidy up
sloppy editing into nicely layed out markup? Well now there is! Dave
Raggett's HTML TIDY is a free utility for doing just that. It also works
great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated by specialized
HTML editors and conversion tools, and can help you identify where you
need to pay further attention on making your pages more accessible to
people with disabilities.
<p>
<p>
Tidy is able to fix up a wide range of problems and to bring to your
attention things that you need to work on yourself. Each item found is
listed with the line number and column so that you can see where the
problem lies in your markup. Tidy won't generate a cleaned up version
when there are problems that it can't be sure of how to handle. These
are logged as "errors" rather than "warnings".
<p>
<p>
There is a standalone binary /usr/bin/tidy built on this library,
contained in the package "tidy".

=Pkg: poppler 0.5.3 7 i586
=Sum: PDF Rendering Library
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
Poppler is a fork of the xpdf PDF viewer developed by Derek Noonburg
of Glyph and Cog, LLC.  The purpose of forking xpdf is twofold.
First, to provide PDF rendering functionality as a shared
library to centralize the maintenence effort. Today a number of
applications incorporate the xpdf code base and whenever a security
issue is discovered, all these applications exchange patches and put
out new releases.  In turn, all distributions must package and release
new versions of these xpdf based viewers.  It is safe to say that
there is a lot of duplicated effort with the current situation.  Even if
poppler in the short term introduces yet another xpdf-derived code
base to the world, it is hoped that over time these applications will
adopt poppler.  After all, only one application needs to use poppler
to break even.
<p>
Second, libpoppler intends to move forward in a number of areas
that do not fit within the goals of xpdf.  By design, xpdf depends on
very few libraries and runs on a wide range of X-based platforms.  This
is a strong feature and reasonable design goal.  However, poppler
intends to replace parts of xpdf that are now available as
standard components of modern Unix desktop environments.  One such
example is fontconfig, which solves the problem of matching and
locating fonts on the system in a standardized and well understood
way.  Another example is cairo, which provides high quality 2D
rendering.  See the file TODO for a list of planned changes.

A Development Tool
<hr>
Twisted is a framework, written in Python, for writing networked applications. It includes implementations of a number of commonly used network services such as a web server, an IRC chat server, a mail server, a relational database interface and an object broker. Developers can build applications using all of these services as well as custom services that they write themselves. Twisted also includes a user authentication system that controls access to services and provides services with user context information to implement their own security models.
<p>
Twisted provides important features needed for networking programming, both at the high and low levels:
<p>
Pluggable event loops allowing the developer to take advantage of platform-specific capabilities.
Abstractions of protocols and transports.
Through Twisted Spread, mechanisms for network encoding of data (in Python, Java, ELisp, and other languages), to a full-blown distributed object system.
<p>
An Integrated Environment
<hr>
Twisted is an integration point for network services that were previously unable to interoperate. Services within a Twisted server can communicate with each other and share information providing a very integrated programming environment that can re-use large amounts of infrastructure across multiple network mediums (such as chat, web, and mail).
<p>
As well as servers, Twisted supports several different kinds of clients and GUIs. This means that the client can re-use large portions of the server's code, improving test coverage and reliability while reducing code size.
<p>
An Application Suite
<hr>
Twisted is a collection of servers and clients, which can be used either by developers of new applications or directly. For example an easy to run web server is available out of the box as an application for the desktop user, but it is also a framework for developers to use.

<!-- DT:Rich -->
SMARTmontools controls and monitors storage devices using the
Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology System (S.M.A.R.T.)
built into ATA and SCSI Hard Drives.  This is used to check
hard drive reliability and to predict drive failures.  The suite
is derived from the smartsuite package, and contains two utilities.  The
first, smartctl, is a command line utility designed to perform simple
S.M.A.R.T. tasks.  The second, smartd, is a daemon that periodically
monitors smart status and reports errors to syslog.  The package is
compatible with the ATA/ATAPI-5 specification.  Future releases will be
compatible with the ATA/ATAPI-6 and ATA/ATAPI-7 specifications.  The
package is intended to incorporate as much "vendor specific" and
"reserved" information as possible about disk drives. The commands

<!-- DT:Rich -->
Xen is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation.
<p>
This package contains the needed BIOS and device emulation code to support unmodified guests. (You need virtualization support in hardware to make use of this.)
<p>
Modern computers are sufficiently powerful to use virtualization to present the illusion of many smaller virtual machines (VMs), each running a separate operating system instance. Successful partitioning of a machine to support the concurrent execution of multiple operating systems poses several challenges. Firstly, virtual machines must be isolated from one another: It is not acceptable for the execution of one to adversely affect the performance of another. This is particularly true when virtual machines are owned by mutually untrusting users. Secondly, it is necessary to support a variety of different operating systems to accommodate the heterogeneity of popular applications. Thirdly, the performance overhead introduced by virtualization should be small.
<p>
Xen uses a technique called paravirtualization: The guest OS is modified, mainly to enhance performance.
<p>
The Xen hypervisor (microkernel) does not provide device drivers for your hardware (except for CPU and memory). This job is left to the kernel that's running in domain 0. Thus the domain 0 kernel is privileged; it has full hardware access. It's started immediately after Xen starts up. Other domains have no access to the hardware; instead they use virtual interfaces that are provided by Xen (with the help of the domain 0 kernel).
<p>
Xen does support booting other Operating Systems; ports of NetBSD (Christian Limpach), FreeBSD (Kip Macy), and Plan 9 (Ron Minnich) exist. A port of Windows XP was developed for an earlier version of Xen, but is not available for release due to license restrictions.
<p>
In addition to this package you need to install kernel-xen, xen, and xen-tools to use Xen.

=Pkg: xscreensaver 5.00 3 i586
=Sum: A screen saver and locker for the X Window System
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
The xscreensaver program waits until the keyboard and mouse have been idle for
a period of time, and then runs a graphics demo chosen at random. It turns off as soon
as there is any mouse or keyboard activity. It can also lock the screen
immediately, after a longer idle period, or on demand.
<p>
The xscreensaver package consists of two parts: the screensaver and the
"driver" or "daemon", which detects idleness and does locking,
and the many graphics demos that are launched by xscreensaver.
<p>
Any X program that can draw on the root window can be used with xscreensaver,
regardless of how that program is written, what language it is written in,
or what libraries it uses. The xscreensaver daemon takes care of detecting when
the user is idle, locking, and checking passwords and all the other
book-keeping. All the other programs need to do is draw.
<p>
The benefit that xscreensaver has over the combination of the xlock and
xautolock programs is the ease with which new graphic hacks can be installed.
You do not need to recompile (or even re-run) the xscreensaver program to add
a new display mode, you just change a config file.

=Pkg: ImageMagick-Magick++-devel 6.2.8 5 i586
=Sum: C++ Interface for ImageMagick - files mandatory for development
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
This is Magick++, the object-oriented C++ API for the ImageMagick
image-processing library.
<p>
Magick++ supports an object model inspired by PerlMagick. Magick++
should be faster than PerlMagick since it is written in a compiled
language which is not parsed at run-time. This makes it suitable for Web CGI
programs. Images support implicit reference counting so that copy
constructors and assignment incur almost no cost. The cost of actually
copying an image (if necessary) is done just before modification and this
copy is managed automatically by Magick++. De-referenced copies are
automatically deleted. The image objects support value (rather than
pointer) semantics so it is trivial to support multiple generations of an
image in memory at one time.

You can also resize, rotate, sharpen, color-reduce, or add special effects
to an image and save your completed work in many different image formats.
Image processing operations are available from the command line as well
as through C, C++, and PERL-based programming interfaces.

<!-- DT:Rich -->
Glitz is an OpenGL image compositing library. Glitz provides
Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask generation for
geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles, and rectangles.
<p>
The semantics of glitz are designed to precisely match the
specification of the X Render extension. Glitz does not only implement
X Render features like component alpha and image transformations, but
also support for additional features like convolution filters and color
gradients, which are not currently part of the X Render specification.
<p>
The performance and capabilities of glitz are much dependent on
graphics hardware. Glitz does not in any way handle software
fall-backs when graphics hardware is insufficient. However, glitz
will report if any requested operation cannot be carried out by
graphics hardware, hence making a higher level software layer
responsible for appropriate actions.

The front-end /usr/bin/iscan was removed because it requires the proprietary binary-only i386-only "libesmod" library. This should cause no problem because the back-end epkowa runs now natively even on non-i386 platforms so that all the usual front-ends (like scanimage, xscanimage, xsane, and kooka) can be used even on non-i386 platforms.

=Sum: Object Oriented Extension for Tcl
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
Incr Tcl adds object-oriented programming facilities to Tcl.  It
was NOT designed as another whiz-bang, object-oriented programming
language. It is patterned somewhat after C++.  It was designed
to support more structured programming in Tcl.  Scripts that grow
beyond a few thousand lines become extremely difficult to maintain.
[incr Tcl] attacks this problem in the same way that any object-
oriented programming language would, by providing mechanisms for
data encapsulation behind well-defined interfaces.

is completely new and provides support for the following features:
lightweight (no databases needed) lpr, lpc, and lprm programs; dynamic
redirection of print queues; automatic job holding; highly verbose
diagnostics; multiple printers serving a single queue; and a greatly
improved permission and authorization mechanism.

LPRng provides emulation packages for the SVR4 lp and lpstat programs,
eliminating the need for another print spooler package. These emulation
packages can be modified according to local requirements to
support vintage printing systems.

Attention: Interoperability with older LPD implementations
requires privileged access to ports.  Therefore all affected
client-programs ship with SUID root privileges.

=Pkg: perl-Date-Calc 5.4 17 i586
=Sum: Perl Date-Calc Module
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
This package consists of a C library and a Perl module (which uses
the C library, internally) for all kinds of date calculations based
on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in all western countries today),
thereby complying with all relevant norms and standards: ISO/R 2015-1971,
DIN 1355 and, to some extent, ISO 8601 (where applicable).
<p>
(See also http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/Date-Calc/DIN1355/
for a scan of part of the "DIN 1355" document (in German)).
<p>
The module of course handles year numbers of 2000 and above correctly
("Year 2000" or "Y2K" compliance) -- actually all year numbers from 1
to the largest positive integer representable on your system (which
is at least 32767) can be dealt with.
<p>
Note that this package EXTRAPOLATES the Gregorian calendar BACK
until the year 1 A.D. -- even though the Gregorian calendar was only
adopted in 1582 by most (not all) European countries, in obedience to
the corresponding decree of catholic pope Gregor I in that year.
<p>
Some (mainly protestant) countries continued to use the Julian calendar
(used until then) until as late as the beginning of the 20th century.
<p>
Finally, note that this package is not intended to do everything you could
ever imagine automagically for you; it is rather intended to serve as a
toolbox (in the best of UNIX spirit and traditions) which should, however,
always get you where you want to go.

=Pkg: bsf 2.3.0 24 noarch
=Sum: Bean Scripting Framework
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes that provides
scripting language support within Java applications and access to Java
objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows writing
JSPs in languages other than Java while providing access to the Java
class library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be
implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is
embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
calling scripting language engines from within Java as well as an
object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language
engines.
<p>
This BSF package currently supports several scripting languages:<ul>
<li>Javascript (using Rhino ECMAScript, from the Mozilla project)
<li>XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and
Xerces)
</ul>
In addition, the following languages are supported with their own BSF
engines:<ul>
<li>Java (using BeanShell, from the BeanShell project)
<li>JRuby
<li>JudoScript
</ul>

=Pkg: bsh2 2.0 17 noarch
=Sum: Lightweight Scripting for Java (BeanShell Version 2.x)
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with object scripting language features, written in Java.
BeanShell executes standard Java statements and expressions, in addition to obvious scripting commands and syntax.
BeanShell supports scripted objects as simple method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript(tm).
You can use BeanShell interactively for Java experimentation and debugging or as a simple scripting engine for your applications.
In short: BeanShell is a dynamically interpreted Java, plus some useful stuff.
Another way to describe it is to say that in many ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell is embeddable - You can call BeanShell from your Java applications to execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide scripting extensibility for your applications.
Alternatively, you can call your Java applications and objects from BeanShell;
working with Java objects and APIs dynamically.
Since BeanShell is written in Java and runs in the same space as your application, you can freely pass references to "real live" objects into scripts and return them as results.
<p>
With version 2.0 BeanShell becomes a fully Java compatible scripting language.
BeanShell is now capable of interpreting ordinary Java source and loading .java source files from the class path.
BeanShell scripted classes are fully typed and appear to outside Java code and
via reflective inspection as ordinary classes.
However their implementation is fully dynamic and they may include arbitrary BeanShell scripts in their bodies, methods, and constructors.
Users may now freely mix loose, unstructured BeanShell scripts, method closures, and full scripted classes.

=Pkg: apache2-mod_perl 2.0.2 20 i586
=Sum: Embedded Perl for Apache
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
The Apache/Perl integration project brings together the full power of
the Perl programming language and the Apache HTTP server.
<p>
With mod_perl, it is possible to write Apache modules entirely in
Perl. The persistent interpreter embedded in the server
avoids the overhead of starting an external interpreter and the
penalty of Perl start-up time.
<p>
Note that you do not need mod_perl to run perl scripts via the common gateway
interface (CGI). mod_perl enables you to run Perl scripts in an embedded
interpreter if the additional performance is needed, but may require
modifications to the scripts.
<p>
Usage:
<p>
Add mod_perl to APACHE_MODULES in /etc/sysconfig/apache2 to load it into Apache.
To learn about the configuration, the best reference unequivocally is
http://perl.apache.org/docs/
<p>
For porting 1.0 applications to 2.0, the page
http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/user/porting/compat.html should give the
required information.
<p>
Most mod_perl handlers use the perl-script handler. Scripts can run in
"mod_perl mode" (preconfigured for URLs starting with /perl/) or "perl cgi
mode" (preconfigured for URLs starting /cgi-perl). Plain CGI scripts can be run
via /cgi-bin/. In all these cases, the script would be placed inside the
/srv/www/cgi-bin/ directory. Refer to /etc/apache2/conf.d/mod_perl.conf about
this configuration.

=Pkg: apache2-mod_python 3.2.10 5 i586
=Sum: A Python Module for the Apache 2 Web Server
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
mod_python allows embedding Python within the Apache HTTP server for a
considerable boost in performance and added flexibility in designing
Web-based applications.
<p>
<p>
Apache processes requests in stages (for example: read the request, parse
headers, check access, and so on). These stages can be implemented by
functions called handlers. Traditionally, handlers are written in C
and compiled into Apache modules. mod_python provides a way to extend
Apache functionality by writing Apache handlers in Python. For a
detailed description of the Apache request processing process, see the
Apache API notes.
<p>
<p>
For most programmers, the request and the authentication handlers
provide everything required. To ease migration from CGI and Httpdapy,
two handlers are provided that simulate these environments, allowing a
user to run scripts under mod_python with (for the most part) no
changes to the code.
<p>
<p>
mod_python originated from a project called Httpdapy. For a long time,
Httpdapy was not called mod_python because Httpdapy was not meant to
be Apache-specific. Httpdapy was designed to be cross-platform and
was initially written for the Netscape server.
<p>
<p>
Usage Hints:
<p>
To load mod_python into Apache, add it to APACHE_MODULES in
/etc/sysconfig/apache2.
The configuration is described in
/usr/share/doc/packages/apache2-mod_python/doc-html/index.html.

<!-- DT:Rich -->
DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs.  Its purpose is to
provide a single front-end for all tests.  Beyond this, DejaGnu offers
several advantages for testing:
<ol>
<li>The flexibility and consistency of the DejaGnu framework make it easy to write tests for any program.

<li>DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction that allows you to write tests that are portable to any host or target where a program must be tested.  For instance, a test for GDB can run (from any Unix-based host) on any target architecture that DejaGnu supports.

<li>All tests have the same output format.  This makes it easy to integrate testing into other software development processes. DejaGnu's output is designed to be parsed by other filtering scripts and it is also human-readable.
</ol>
DejaGnu is written in <a href="pkg://expect">expect</a>, which in turn uses "Tcl"--Tool
command language.
<p>
Running tests requires two things: the testing framework and the
test suites themselves.

FPing is a ping-like program that uses the Internet Control
Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is
responding. FPing differs from ping in that you can specify any
number of targets on the command line or specify a file containing a
list of targets to ping. Instead of sending pings to one target until
it times out or replies, FPing sends a ping packet and moves on
to the next target in a round-robin fashion.
<p>
In the default mode, if a target replies, it is noted and removed from
the list of targets to check. If a target does not respond within a
certain time limit or retry limit, it is designated as unreachable.
FPing also supports sending a specified number of pings to a target
or looping indefinitely (as in ping).

Unlike ping, FPing is meant to be used in scripts. Its output is
designed to be easy to parse.

<!-- DT:Rich -->
FreeWnn is a Kana-Kanji translation system, originally developed by a
joint project made up of Kyoto University, OMRON Corporation [formerly
known as Tateishi Electronics Co.], and ASTEC Inc. Further
development and maintenance is now done by the "FreeWnn Project"
(http://www.freewnn.org).
<p>
<p>
The name "Wnn", is an acronym for the Japanese sentence "Watashino
Namaeha Nakanodesu" (literally, it means "my name is Nakano."), and is
derived from a goal of the project: to develop a system powerful
enough to translate a whole sentence like that at once.  The source
code has been written in C and is freely distributed. Consequently,
Wnn spread widely among workstation platforms, and became a de facto
standard as a Kana-Kanji translation system for UNIX operating
systems.
<p>
<p>
Wnn works in a client/server manner. The server portion of Wnn, or
jserver, is used as a Kana-Kanji translation engine for clients like
"xwnmo" and "kinput2" (input systems for the X Window System) or for
clients like "Egg", which are part of Mule (MUlti-Lingual Emacs) and
XEmacs.

character, conventional pronunciation-based methods of entering the
character are probably faster.

LT XML provides two views of an XML file; one as a flat stream of markup
elements and text; a second as a sequence of tree-structured XML
elements. The two views can be mixed, allowing great flexibility in the
manipulation of XML documents. It also includes a powerful, yet simple,
querying language, which allows the user to quickly and easily select
those parts of an XML document which are of interest.

<!-- DT:Rich -->
SQL is the most popular database language in the world. MySQL is a
client/server implementation that consists of a server daemon (mysqld)
and many different client programs and libraries.
<p>
The main goals of MySQL are speed, robustness, and ease of use. MySQL
was originally developed because the developers at TcX needed an SQL
server that could handle very large databases an order of magnitude
faster than what any database vendor could offer them. They have now
been using MySQL since 1996 in an environment with more than 40 databases
containing 10,000 tables, of which more than 500 have more than 7 million
rows. This is about 100 gigabytes of mission-critical data.
<p>
The base upon which MySQL is built is a set of routines that have been
used in a highly demanding production environment for many years. While
MySQL is still in development, it already offers a rich and highly useful
function set.
<p>
The official way to pronounce MySQL is "My Ess Que Ell" (Not MY-SEQUEL).

This package only contains the server-side programs.

it isn't included in the reference count of the thing referred to.
This means that once all references to a particular piece of data are
weak, the piece of data is freed and all the weak references are set
to undef. This is particularly useful for implementing circular
data structures without memory leaks or caches of objects.

<!-- DT:Rich -->
Hard disks are the most commonly replaced system elements, and
are therefore a critical consideration for improving availability. Root Disk
Mirroring (RAID-1) is the technique of using redundant disks to record
multiple copies of the data so that one disk failure will not cause
data loss.
<p>
This project includes changes that enhance the Reliability, Availability, and
Serviceability (RAS) of the drivers that are commonly used in a Linux
software RAID-1 configuration. Other efforts have been made to enable
various common hardware RAID adapters and their drivers on Linux.
<p>
The tools in this project were designed to add to the serviceability of SCSI
devices under Linux so that the system does not have to be rebooted or taken
out of service to perform common maintenance or service functions. This project
has user-space and kernel level components:
<p>
sgraidmon - a tool to monitor software RAID disks for hot-insertion/removal;
Note that this uses raidtools like mdadm to re-configure the new disk.
sgdefects - a tool to read the primary and grown defect lists
sgdskfl - a tool to load disk firmware to SCSI disks under Linux; some
sample firmware images are included in the package
sgmode - a tool to get and set SCSI device mode pages; some sample mode page
definition files are included in the package
sgdiag - a tool to perform format and other diagnostic functions

=Sum: The Base System of teTeX
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
After installing teTeX and the package te_latex, find a large selection of documentation
for TeX, LaTeX, and various layout styles in /usr/share/texmf/doc.
<p>
TeX (pronounced tech) is an interpreter for text formatting and was
developed by Donald E. Knuth.  It works with control and macro
commands on a text file.
Working with TeX is similar to typesetting methods.
LaTeX or better LaTeX2e is a complex macro package that removes
the cryptical TeX interface and does most of the work for the user.
<p>
TeX uses special fonts produced by the MetaFont program.
Various printer drivers and an X11 viewer are also included in this package.
The teTeX package is based on the standard TeX package of Karl Berry,
which makes configuration much easier.
It is also possible to use PostScript fonts. A real PostScript printer is
required, however.
If the ghostscript (gs) package is installed, all drivers for
printing and viewing can use these fonts. Note, however, that the
fonts included in the ghostscript package are not identical
to Adobe's PostScript fonts. The copyright prohibits us from
including them on the CD.
<p>
Besides these features, there are the programs MakeIndex (for producing
indexes), BibTeX (for literature data processing), and the script xtexsh
(requires tcl/tk).
<p>
Note the differences between LaTeX2.09 and LaTeX2e.
LaTeX2e can process original LaTeX2.09 text, but
style files that require LaTeX2.09 internal macros may
not work correctly.  Under /usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/base/,
find the documentation for LaTeX2e.  New users
should review the documentation stored there.
<p>
The teTeX package from Thomas Esser includes a full
texmf tree, many programs (tex, dvips, etc.), shell script
configuration, and a big collection of documentations.
This package is simply configured by the script texconfig
and has multilanguage options.
<p>
Do not install this package together with ntex. ntex is not delivered in
SUSE Linux.
<p>
teTeX is not an upgrade or update for the ntex package.

Raggett's HTML TIDY is a free utility for doing just that. It also works
great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated by specialized
HTML editors and conversion tools, and can help you identify where you
need to pay further attention on making your pages more accessible to
people with disabilities.
<p>
<p>
Tidy is able to fix up a wide range of problems and to bring to your
attention things that you need to work on yourself. Each item found is
listed with the line number and column so that you can see where the
problem lies in your markup. Tidy won't generate a cleaned up version
when there are problems that it can't be sure of how to handle. These
are logged as "errors" rather than "warnings".

It supports merging several GIFs into a GIF animation; exploding an
animation into its component frames; changing individual frames in an
animation; turning interlacing on and off; adding transparency; adding
delays, disposals, and looping to animations; adding or removing comments;
flipping and rotation; optimizing animations for space; and changing
images' colormaps, among other things. Extensive command-line options
control which, if any, of these occur.
<p>
Gifview, a companion program requiring X11, displays GIF images and
animations on an X display. It can display multi-frame GIFs either as
slideshows, displaying one frame at a time, or as real-time animations.

Valgrind checks all memory operations in an application, like read, write, malloc, new, free, and delete. Valgrind can find uses of uninitialized memory, access to already freed memory, overflows, illegal stack operations, memory leaks, and any illegal new/malloc/free/delete commands.
Another program in the package is "cachegrind," a profiler based on the
valgrind engine.
<p>
To use valgrind you should compile your application with "-g -O0" compiler options. Afterwards you can use it with:
<p>
valgrind --tool=memcheck
--sloppy-malloc=yes
--leak-check=yes
--db-attach=yes my_application, for example.
<p>
More valgrind options can be listed via "valgrind --help". There is also complete documentation in the /usr/share/doc/packages/valgrind/ directory.
A debugged application runs slower and needs much more memory, but is usually still usable. Valgrind is still in development, but it has been successfully used to optimize several KDE applications.

x3270  X Window System
c3270  curses based
<li>terminal emulators for scripted use
s3270    see the x3270-script man page
tcl3270  Tcl based
<li>printer emulator pr3287
<li>do not miss the punch card puncher emulator x026
</ul>
x3270 is an IBM 3270 terminal emulator for the X Window System.  x3270
runs over a telnet connection (with or without TN3270E) and emulates
either an IBM 3279 (color) or 3278 (monochrome).  It supports APL2
characters, IND$FILE file transfer, NVT mode, a pop-up keypad for
3270-specific keys, alternative keymaps, 3287 printer sessions, and a
scrollbar and has extensive debugging and scripting facilities.
<p>
c3270 is the curses-based version of x3270.  It runs on any dumb
terminal (an xterm or a console, for example), and supports (almost) all of the
x3270 features.  c3270 scripts are compatible with x3270 scripts,
and the subset of command line options and resource definitions are
also compatible.
<p>
s3270 is a scripting-only version of x3270.  This program is intended
primarily for writing "screen-scraping" applications, for example a CGI
back-end script that retrieves database information from a mainframe.
<p>
tcl3270 is a Tcl-based 3270 scripting engine.  It lets you write Tcl
scripts that manipulate 3270 sessions, and is quite a bit easier to
set up and use than s3270.
<p>
pr3287 is the printer companion for the above tools, and allows
printer output from a 3270 session to be directed to a Unix printer
queue.

+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
The EDICT file is the outcome of a voluntary project to produce a
freely available Japanese-English Dictionary in machine readable
form. This project has been under way since early 1991, beginning with
the small original file included with the MOKE (Mark's Own Kanji
Editor) Japanese word processing package. It had reached a size of nearly
103,000 entries when it was split into two files: EDICT containing the
"normal" dictionary entries, and ENAMDICT containing names. Both files
are used by a number of software packages and thousands of users
worldwide. The EDICT file now has over 60,000 entries and the ENAMDICT
file has over 160,000 entries.
<p>
<p>
Meanwhile, there are also some additional dictionary files for
special purposes, COMPDIC, for example, for words from the computing
and communication field.

EDICT entries containing that key in a pop-up buffer.  English is
even easier: you just point anywhere in the word you want to look
up.

Bob Kerns added a morphology engine, which reduces a highly inflected
Japanese word to a list of dictionary forms (for example itta -> (iku, iu)),
all of which are looked up.

+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
This is an autoloadable interface module for libgd, a popular library
for creating and manipulating PNG files.  With this library you can
create PNG images on the fly or modify existing files.
<p>
This version of GD no longer supports GIF output because of threats from
the legal department at Unisys.  Source code that calls $image->gif will
have to be changed to call either $image->jpg or $image->png to output
in JPEG or PNG formats. The last version of GD that supported GIF output
was version 1.19.

=Pkg: perl-HTML-Clean 0.8 685 i586
=Sum: Cleans up HTML code for web browsers, not humans
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
The majority of the web pages of the internet today are
much larger than they need to be.  The reason for this is
that HTML tends to be stored in a human readable format, with
indenting, newlines and comments.
<p>
<p>
However, all of these comments, whitespace etc. are ignored by
the browser, and needlessly lengthen download times.
<p>
<p>
Second, many people are using WYSIWYG HTML editors these days.
This makes creating content easy.  However these editors can
cause a number of compatibility problems by tying themselves to
a particular browser or operating system.

-Des:
##----------------------------------------
=Pkg: perl-HTML-SimpleParse 0.12 137 i586
=Sum: a bare-bones HTML parser
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
This is the HTML::SimpleParse module.  It is a bare-bones HTML parser,
similar to HTML::Parser, but with a couple important distinctions:
<p>
<p>
First, HTML::Parser knows which tags can contain other tags, which
start tags have corresponding end tags, which tags can exist only in
the <HEAD> portion of the document, and so forth.  HTML::SimpleParse
does not know any of these things.  It just finds tags and text in the
HTML you give it, it does not care about the specific content of these
tags (though it does distiguish between different _types_ of tags,
such as comments, starting tags like <b>, ending tags like </b>, and
so on).
<p>
<p>
Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML
content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any
attention to balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or
which pairs of tags are inside other pairs of tags.
<p>
<p>
Because of these characteristics, you can make a very effective HTML
filter by sub-classing HTML::SimpleParse.

=Sum: PDF rendering library
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
Poppler is a fork of the xpdf PDF viewer developed by Derek Noonburg
of Glyph and Cog, LLC.  The purpose of forking xpdf is twofold.
First, we want to provide PDF rendering functionality as a shared
library, to centralize the maintenence effort. Today a number of
applications incorporate the xpdf code base, and whenever a security
issue is discovered, all these applications exchange patches and put
out new releases.  In turn, all distributions must package and release
new version of these xpdf based viewers.  It's safe to say that
there's a lot of duplicated effort with the current situation.  Even if
poppler in the short term introduces yet another xpdf derived code
base to the world, we hope that over time these applications will
adopt poppler.  After all, we only need one application to use poppler
to break even.
<p>
Second, we would like to move libpoppler forward in a number of areas
that doesn't fit within the goals of xpdf.  By design, xpdf depends on
very few libraries and runs a wide range of X based platforms.  This
is a strong feature and reasonable design goal.  However, with poppler
we would like to replace parts of xpdf that are now available as
standard components of modern Unix desktop environments.  One such
example is fontconfig, which solves the problem of matching and
locating fonts on the system, in a standardized and well understood
way.  Another example is cairo, which provides high quality 2D
rendering.  See the file TODO for a list of planned changes.

Make-like tools are inherently shell-based--they evaluate a set of
dependencies then execute commands, not unlike what you would issue in a shell.
This means that you can easily extend these tools by using or writing any
program for the OS that you are working on. However, this also means that you
limit yourself to the OS, or at least the OS type, such as Unix, that you are
working on.
<p>
Makefiles are inherently evil as well. Anybody who has worked on them for any
time has run into the dreaded tab problem. "Is my command not executing because
I have a space in front of my tab???" said the original author of Ant way too
many times. Tools like Jam took care of this to a great degree, but still have
yet another format to use and remember.
<p>
Ant is different. Instead of a model where it is extended with shell-based
commands, Ant is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing shell
commands, the configuration files are XML-based, calling out a target tree
where various tasks are executed. Each task is run by an object that implements
a particular task interface.
<p>
Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by being
able to construct a shell command such as `find . -name foo -exec rm {}`, but
it gives you the ability to be cross-platform--to work anywhere and
everywhere. If you really need to execute a shell command, Ant has an
<exec> task that allows different commands to be executed based on the OS used.

=Sum: A Best-Effort Text Printer (Works in UTF-8 and Can Replace a2ps)
+Des:
<!-- DT:Rich -->
Cedilla is a "best-effort" text printer that uses Unicode internally.
<p>
<p>
Using Unicode means that the set of characters that can appear in the input
is very large and the user may very well have no font available that
contains glyphs for the characters that the user wants to print.  Cedilla attempts
to at least partially solve this problem using a number of techniques:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Cedilla can use an arbitrary number of downloadable fonts. For any given
print job, only the necessary fonts are downloaded.
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Cedilla uses its own built-in font, which contains a number of
useful glyphs that are missing from standard fonts.
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Cedilla modifies existing glyphs in order to, for example, remove dots or
add bars.
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Cedilla attempts to build composite glyphs (for accented
characters, for example) on the fly.
</ol>

<li>Cedilla uses fallbacks for characters that are not supported by the
available fonts.

implementations, and the Jakarta-Commons Collections Component strives
to fulfill them. Among the features of this package are:<ul>
<li>special-purpose implementations of Lists and Maps for fast access

<li>You want to avoid having to handle native file and path separators or native path quoting issues.
<li>You need to enforce certain system properties, such as java.endorsed.dirs when running with JDK 1.4.
<li>You want to allow users to pass custom JVM arguments or system properties without having to parse and reorder arguments in your script. This can be tricky or messy in batch and shell scripts.
<li>You want to bootstrap system properties from a configuration file instead hard-coding them in your batch and shell scripts.
