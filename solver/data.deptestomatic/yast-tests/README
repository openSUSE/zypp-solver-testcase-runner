Comments to the yast (PHI) test cases

- conflicts of an installed package don't match to-be-installed providers
  (-> r_and_d::verify checks channel equality)
  [Fixed by --enable-phi]

- uninstalls can be replaced by upgrades, the solver doesn't check this
  (exercise-02conflict-08-test.xml and exercise-02conflict-09-test.xml fail currently)
  [Fixed by --enable-phi]

- A limited conflict (foo <= 1.2) also triggers for 'foo' in rc but not in phi
  (exercise-04obsoletes-03-test.xml)


FIXME: xfail contains testcases which currently fail
